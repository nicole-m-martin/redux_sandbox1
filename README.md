All about Redux with React

## What is ***Redux***?
>Redux is a package aka a state management tool, that creates a **Global State** that you share between **React Components** (no parent / child relationship required)


When using Redux you don't actually change the **State**, you create updated copies of the state that are inserted into React **components**.

## React Terms
**React**: A Javascript library by Facebook, used for building user interfaces, and allows devs to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page. It's goal is to be fast, scalable and simple.  

**Component**:  conceptually they are like Javascript functions. They always start with a capital letter. They are **resusable** bits of code. Small, contained JavaScript files where you can keep all of your HTML and JavaScript in one place. There are two kinds, Class and Functional. Class components are also known as **Stateful**, they implement logic and state. Functional or **Stateless** components are plain JS functions that accept **props** as an argument and return a React element. They accept data and display them in some form. 

**State**: is the condition of something at a particular point in time. A dynamic form of storage that lives in our components. It is a javascript object used by React to represent information about a component's current situation. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering. 

**Props**: Short for 'properties', they are variables used to pass data from one component to another. From a parent component to child component. Props data is immutable or 'read-only'
